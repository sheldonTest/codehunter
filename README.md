Hello follow developers!

Here is my demo application demonstrating the following:

1.) My use of the Kotlin programming language 2.) My implementation of CLEAN architecture and MVVM design patterns

This app is a simple stackoverflow viewer

To get access to the code hit the green code button located on the right. From there you can download the Android Studio project.

NOTE: This app was tested using API level 30 and Android 10
